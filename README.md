### Aditional comments/ considerations
- Initailly generated repo for this project and made periodic commits, git pulls etc. via terminal.
  However, due to technical issues communicating with GitLab via terminal the author ceased employing  terminal for file but instead created a new repo and upload files via GitHub GUI. This is the reason for a lack of commits, pulls etc.
